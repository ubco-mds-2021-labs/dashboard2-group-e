# Project Proposal

## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role:** Data Scientists at a Superstore    
**Target audience:** Store sales productivity and general managers, marketing team and the CFO.

Managing one of the biggest supermarket chain in Canada is no easy task. Tracking sales and profit figures across different states and segments can be challenging as there is a lot of data to process. Data visualization tools such as a sales dashboard can help paint a clear picture of the performance of the stores in each state and segments. Our app will enable the target audience to explore different sales metrics for each state in order to better understand what factors contribute to a higher profit. This app also offers a tool that predicts the daily profit margin given certain variables such as the shipment mode, the state and the product category. Finally, this tool will help the marketing team target which category of products they should focus their efforts on.

**Description of Data**  

The dataset contains details for the orders of a Superstore in the US, sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/nazarmahadialseied/superstore-sales]. This dataset will help us to understand which attribute has affected the sales and profit for the superstore sales. The dataset consists of 13 different attributes of a sample of entries. Attributes are ordinal, categorical and quantitative. Each of the rows (9994 samples) corresponds to a combination of attributes like ship mode, segment, country, city, stat, postal code, region category, sub-category, quantity, and discount with the sales and profit associated with them. The goal of this data is to establish value insights from their sales such as average sales, profits from different regions, categories, etc. which could help the Superstores make good strategies for their business future plan in the market. These estimates could be used to identify which sector of the market is under loss and which sector is making huge profits which supports the business to make appropriate decisions.


## Section 3: 

**Research Questions and Usage Scenarios**    

**Research Questions:**   
- What is the most and least sold sub-category for each category in terms of sales? How does this differ for each state?    
- Which states tend to have the most of their orders made through second class?     
- Given information about a particular order (shipment mode, segment, state, category, sub-category) what will the sales, profit, and profit margin be?     
- How does discount affecting the total number of sales and profit of each product categories/sub-categories?    
   
**Usage:**

Joe is a sales productivity manager and is interested in learning more about the distribution of sales and profits for the different states in the US. He is hoping to use this application in order to gather a multitude of different information and that, all in one place! When Joe selects a given state on the map of the United States, various information will be updated to reflect this state's reality in terms of sales. For example, he can select via a drop down menu the product category that interests him and the corresponding sales and profit for this category will be illustrated using a bar chart. Also, he will be able to view the proportion of sales, profit or items sold (depending on what he selects using the radio buttons) that correspond to the different segments (consumer, corporate and home office). Furthermore, Joe will easily be able to see the bestseller items for this state. He is also interested in knowing if offering discounts increases the sales and profits considerably or if the marketing team should think of a better way to attract clients. Finally, Joe will be able to use the app in order to predict future profit margin given a particular order (shipment mode, segment, state, category, sub-category).

In short, Joe will use the app to gain a better understanding of the stores' productivity which in return will enable him to come up with strategies to improve it.
