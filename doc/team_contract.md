# Team Working Contract

Below is a teamwork contract template adapted from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/designteach/teach/instructionalstrategies/groupprojects/tools/index.html).
It is divided into several sections, and it is expected that each group will spend some time generating at least 5 points for each section that **everyone agrees** to. 

If you are not able to agree on these points, it is a sign that your group may become dysfunctional, and you should seek advice from me (the course instructor) ASAP to resolve and mediate the discussion.

## Team Members

## Participation

All team members agree to fully participate in all aspects of the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete actions that we all agree to take:

1. We will first start by making a to-do list for the project and divide the tasks equally among the team members. 
2. We will meet every week in order to update this list and reassign tasks accordingly.
3. We agree to work as many hours as it takes to complete our weekly tasks (we expect this to be around 5 hours but some weeks might require more time).
4. We will meet once at least once a week, during lab time.
5. We expect each of us to deliver our best effort in working towards the project. Feedback is welcome between teamates in order to ensure we produce the best dashboard possible.

## Communication

All team members agree to communicate openly and transparently during the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete actions that we all agree to take:

1. We will start our weekly meeting with a stand-up where every team member will describe what they have been working on. Then, we will establish what is left to do and proceed as necessary.
2. We will notify team members if something arises and we are unable to meet for the weekly meeting.
3. We will communicate with other team members if we run into a problem and help other team members if they run into a problem.
4. We will respect each team members' opinions by listening to their comments or feedbacks during meetings.
5. We will communicate with the other team members as necessary outside the weekly meeting.

## Meetings

All team members agree to meet regularly during the project.
To accomplish this goal, below are five concrete ideas that we all agree to regarding scheduling and frequency of meetings:


1. We have established a meeting schedule (once a week during lab time). 
2. We will communicate through slack during the week if we have any concerns that needs to be addressed.
3. Depending on availability of teammates, we can have options to host the meating online or in-person.
4. If one team member is unable to attend the meeting then we will send a summary of the meeting to the person.
5. We can have more or less meeting depending on the workload.

## Conduct

The code of conduct we have chosen is in the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.
All team members agree to following the code of conduct, and below are five concrete escalation steps that we all agree to follow in the event that the code of conduct is violated by any member of the group (Step 1 is the first thing you will do, and Step 5 is the last thing you will do).

1. Send a message to the team member that violates the code of conduct, mentioning that we think the behaviour is inappropriate.
2. Give a formal warning to the team member that violates the code of conduct and let the person know what the next consequences will be if the person's behaviour continues.
3. Request for a public apology for the violation that the person has conducted.
4. Talk to the lecturer or teaching assistant to help mediate the conflict.
5. Removing their access to the project repository.

*N.B. Please do not hesitate to expand beyond 5 steps if needed.*

## Conflict Management

Despite our best intentions, conflict may invariably arise within teammates.
Discuss amongst your team some conflict mitigation strategies (feel free to search online if needed) and come up with 5 strategies all members of the team agree to follow in the event there is a conflict within the group.
You may also include things you will NOT do in the event a conflict arises.

1. Don't ignore conflict, communicate if you have any reservations. 
2. Clarify the conflicting issues.
3. Hold a meeting with the conflicting parties to discuss the issue.
4. Come up with a solution on how to move forward with the project after the conflict.
5. Follow-up to ensure the conflict has been resolved and no underlying issues remain.

## Deadlines

All team members agree to the following conventions around course deadlines:

1. We agree to submit the project before or on the day of the deadline and aim to submit as early as possible.
2. We commit to deliver our individual task on time so that the project can run smoothly. 
3. We agree to notify the other team members at least one day in advance if we do not think we will make it on time for the deadline.


## Git Workflow

There are many git workflows possible when working on a team project with many moving parts.
I suggest you discuss in your group some possible Git workflows.
[Here is a brief primer on some common options](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows).
I suggest reading them, understanding them, and then selecting one.
You can explore and choose any you like, but if you cannot decide, I suggest using the "Feature Branch Workflow".


All team members agree to the Feature Branch Workflow workflow, and the following conventions (e.g., master branch protection, at least 1 review before a pull request, at least 1 day before the deadline)
